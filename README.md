Classification Technique on the Breast Cancer dataset

## [Introduction]
### Specifically, build a decision tree, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors that predicts the diagnose result based on ten real-valued features (mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest of these features).
- Explore how well different model perform for several different parameter values. When is overfitting and when is underfitting? Show how I set the model that provides the best predictive performance.
- Present a brief overview of your predictive modeling process, explorations, and discuss the results.
- Briefly discuss ROC and lift curves.

## [Conclusion]
### Based on the performance matric, I would choose Logistic Regression for this specific task.

|Model Types| Average Accuracy | F1-Scores |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
|Decision Tree | 0.927 | 0.987 |
|K-NN | 0.927 | 0.977|
|Logistic Regression | 0.977 | 0.985 |
|SVM Classification | 0.970 | 0.987 |
